# ProjectEuler
A collection of solutions for PE problems, and some tools I've built to help solve them

## My initial goal with this project-
I have always enjoyed PE, but in the past a lot of the problems have been way too difficult for me to complete.
Now that I have more programming experience, and have been working professionally, I feel confident in my ability to 
not only solve them, but optimize my solutions to some extent. My goal here is to solve the first 100 problems
consecutively. I initially started this project picking problems that sounded fun, so I have some higher numbered 
problems solved, but I have committed to solving the rest in oder now. 

## Utils
I will add Utils to the PEUtils directory as I see necessary. These will be utilities that aren't specific to any one 
problem, and can be reused throughout this project. Some examples are checking for prime, or checking if a string is a palindrome.



## credits:
All solutions, unless otherwise commented, are my own solutions. I do my best to solve these on my own, but often, certain
things have already been solved in a much more efficient way than I would come up with. These things will always be utilities
I have found online to improve my solutions- e.g. my prime checker is bases on the sieve of eratosthenes, which is obviously
not my creation. I will provide comments on any code I've found online with a link to where I found it.
